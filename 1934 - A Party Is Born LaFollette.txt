/* I'm tearing up and heartbroken right now. Whether La Follette actually hates his brother or not (I don't think he does), I think this mod makes a good argument about how La Follette needs to win or he'll have lost everything. How he lost everything on the way.

Honestly...It makes me all in for a La Follette victory. He deserves this. We can't let his legacy end like this. Losing to Schemedeman would be a disgrace to this amazing man. 

I'm riding with La Follette to the end. This is the final battle of good vs evil. I won't watch a man this good who has suffered this much lose to a complete monster. Philip deserves better than this and so do we. There's still hope. Let's make Fighting Bob proud!

You have won the 1934 Election.</h3><p>With the final speeches given, you retire to Maple Bluff to listen to the results with Bob. You have a feeling in the pit of your stomach. You see it in Bob as well - a slow walk to his desk, a tense look at the phone. You try to comfort him a little, tell him he's going to win this, and he rejects it. \"You know it's about more than that,\" he says. You know he's right.</p><p>Soon, he gets a phone call from Newsweek. You sit alone at the corner of the room, thinking things over, waiting by the radio. How odd this has all gone, you think to yourself. This was supposed to be your party, your family's party, and instead you're standing by a platform that's more Amlie than La Follette. You're lucky you were strong enough to keep the party together. You'd be even luckier to pull this off.</p><p>The first conclusive result comes in - Bob has won. You call out the news, and your brother nods before returning to the reporters, his voice betraying his relief.</p><p>It's a relief to you as well. Dad would have liked this. He had his radical side for certain - hell, he campaigned with Socialists in 1924. Debs even voted for him. He knew how to work with activists in order to push for his cause. If you can pull this off - and it looks like you're pulling this off - you can tell America that there's still more Washington can do for its downtrodden. There's more you can do for them, too.</p><p>Your race is called. You're going to be Governor again.</p>";

You have won the 1934 Election.</h3><p>Together at the farm, you and Bob listen as the ballots come in, surrounded by a party of peers. While Bob sits at his desk and talks with Newsweek, you listen to the tallies in the corner. The rest of your family remains by your side, at times sitting around the radio and at times talking among each other. </p><p>First, Bob's race is called - he won, no surprise. Then local elections began being called, some victories, some losses. It took several agonizing hours before the reporter said something conclusive about your race - \"it's looking like Phil, too, will be winning tonight.\" It took even longer for them to finally call your race for certain. But by nightfall, the truth was obvious - you were going to be governor again.</p><p>Once the Newsweek interview ends, Bob joins you in the library and the two of you relax for the first time in months. There is nothing left to do but celebrate, and there is no energy left for celebrations. Instead, you and him and your families simply sit and talk. </p><p>It feels so nice. With the campaign underway, you'd hardly had time for such a relaxed conversation. A lot is going on in each of your lives - both newly married, both considering children, both back in politics. Though you might not say it so plainly, you'll miss him, just a little, when he leaves for Washington. </p><p>You think of the future. You and Bob may not stay on this same path forever. Bob doesn't have your ambition, your bravery - if you're honest, maybe he's better off without your ego. It doesn't matter for now. You and him are here, under this roof, under this party. You have won.</p>";

Sitting at home and listening to the totals, you feel only an icy cold. Every other year, your family had made a tradition of listening to the vote tallies from Maple Bluff. This year, after the nasty family row in the primary, you stay back in Madison and hear the count alone. You feel despondent, tricked by the radicals into betraying your allies. Your party is dead before it starts.</p><p>Yet the voters disagree. In election after election, local and statewide, there is reason to hope. Losses in the North are made up near Milwaukee and Green Bay. Your new voter base is turning out. You have a chance.</p><p>Then, the race for governor is called. You've won. You don't know how to respond - despite everything, you still feel as sad and overwhelmed as before. Bob should be here, Fola should be here. Mom and Dad, too. You wonder how it is at Maple Bluff right now. Is Bob happy about the news?</p><p>Your dismal feelings are interrupted when your wife hands you the phone. It's Mr. Amlie - he's excited as ever. He begins discussing all manner of wild policy, and you stop him. This isn't the time. He pauses and lets out a sigh.</p><p>\"I know, I know. I just… I know you've given a lot to all of this. Hasn't been an easy year.\" He gives an unsteady laugh. \"You've given a second life to Wisconsin's left, to every farmer and worker who's been left out in the cold. I can't thank you enough. I hope you have a nice night, and give your wife my warmest regards.\"</p><p>\"Thank you, Thomas. Best wishes.\"</p>";

The party leadership seemed so willing to cast them out - why celebrate their successes when they would curse yours?</p><p>Yet you can't stop listening to their details, their pains and successes. Each feels like a judgment of your character. You can't decide if you want your party to lose or win, but you know you have to be there, to listen. You start to crack once the senate race is called. Bob starts to speak on the radio, happily thanking his family, his voice tinny and crackling. He's against you now. Fola is against you. Amlie, Dammann, everyone. It feels like not a soul believed in you this election. All you did was try to please them, and they still lined up beside your brother. What did he have that you didn't? Was it really just that he came first?</p><p>You're about to turn the radio off when the announcer comes back, his voice hurried and surprised. Wisconsin is voting for you more than expected. Maybe it's Schemedeman's injury, maybe it's your last speech, but you're rallying. And then he calls it - you're going to be governor.</p><p>You can't… you just can't believe it. Your wife embraces you, but you are almost still. You've beaten everyone. The people of Wisconsin have chosen, and they chose you. They understand that you fight for them. They have a respect for you beyond party, beyond nation, beyond anything. They don't need to be led by outmoded functionaries or whining intellectuals. All they require is you. You can do whatever you require so long as you fight for yourself. You don't need the family, and you don't need the establishment.

Bob won, of course - not easily, but there's just no one else in the state like him. With the rest of the party failing to win a single statewide election, Bob is left as essentially an independent. You're pretty sure he'll rejoin the Republicans in 1940, if he can.</p><p>You can tell he's upset. He imagined himself as a president someday, and so did you. Without the Republicans, there's just no party to take him there. He'll be lucky to keep the seat. You've suffered even more - after this fiasco you'll probably never return to politics again. But it meant something to Bob, too. Reluctantly, he put his trust in you, and you just couldn't build the platform. </p><p>Yet he's not angry, at least not as angry as you thought he'd be. He's just sad. \"Phil, I know you tried,\" he says. \"And you did your best. It's where the whole movement was pushing us - we just couldn't find a way to push back.\" </p><p>He looks out towards the water, and so do you. From the porch of the family house, you can see the state Capitol, brilliant and white, its reflection dancing in the waters below."
